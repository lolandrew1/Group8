                Perspective Taking
              </h3>

                The various sides of the story are the perspectives of the foreign workers, the Qatar government, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and the non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
                <br><br>
The perspective of the foreign workers emphasizes how migrant workers are “in a cycle of abuse” in Qatar (“Reality check: Migrant Workers' Rights with Two Years to the Qatar 2022 World Cup”, n.d.). These workers migrate to Qatar to work to support their families back home. Some of these workers are not paid by the construction firms, others are not allowed to change jobs, others are not allowed to leave Qatar without the permission of their employer, etc (“Reality check: Migrant Workers' Rights with Two Years to the Qatar 2022 World Cup”, n.d.). This makes these foreign workers feel powerless (Kavaler, 2020).
<br> <br>
The perspective of the Qatari leaders and government emphasizes their efforts into ending the abuse of migrant workers, to try to de-emphasize the human rights issues occuring in their country. They wanted to host the World Cup for the world to recognize Qatar and it took a while for the elite in Qatar to realize that the only way for Qatar’s reputation to improve is by addressing the current violations of human rights (Kavaler, 2020). They have recently passed various reforms and laws to change the rights of migrant workers (“World Cup 2022: Qatar still failing to protect workers' rights, says Amnesty International”, 2019). For example, the Qatari government has passed labour reforms, signed an agreement with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization, etc (“World Cup 2022: Qatar still failing to protect workers' rights, says Amnesty International”, 2019). However, the Qatar government did not pass these reforms because of local demand. These laws were passed because of international pressure, more specifically from the western public (Kavaler, 2020).
<br> <br>
The perspective of FIFA emphasizes that they take “World Cup workers’ rights very seriously”, to de-emphasize the idea that one of their events and one of the largest sporting events in the world is occurring in a place where human rights are currently being violated (“World Cup 2022: Qatar still failing to protect workers' rights, says Amnesty International”, 2019). However, FIFA has acknowledged the issues occurring currently in Qatar and they reassure that they will meet international standards (Peltz-Steele, 2016). FIFA makes clear that they are strongly committed to protect human rights (Peltz-Steele, 2016).
<br> <br>
The perspective of NGOs emphasizes the current violations of human rights occurring in Qatar due to the World Cup 2022. Amnesty International and other NGOs have been trying to stop and expose this issue, and have acknowledged some of the changes/efforts made by the Qatari leaders and FIFA. They attempt to protect the rights of these foreign workers and blame this issue on FIFA and the Qatari officials (Kavaler, 2020). These organizations emphasize that there is still a lot to be done to address. This somewhat de-emphasizes the efforts made by the Qatari leaders and FIFA, but NGOs still acknowledge the importance of the changes made so far.
<br>  <br>
The perspective that is the focus is the point of view of the foreign workers. It is important for this perspective to be represented because it is an issue in Qatar that was brought up by hosting the World Cup. These large international events bring to light various issues, like violating human rights, that many people are not aware of. Foreign workers are used in Qatar to construct the facilities and participate in other operations necessary to host the World Cup of 2022. These workers are mistreated and abused for this global event and it is important that everybody is aware of the current situation in Qatar. More specifically, the audience for this perspective are the people that are part/involved in the World Cup of 2022.
