              Given the privilege of hosting the World Cup, Qatar has turned
              towards the exploitation of migrant workers to development the
              necessary facilities for such an event. “In the decade since Qatar
              was awarded the right to host the World Cup, exploitation and
              abuse of these workers has been rampant, with workers exposed to
              forced labour, unpaid wages and excessive working hours” (“Reality
              check: Migrant Workers' Rights with Two Years to the Qatar 2022
              World Cup”, n.d.)
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Thousand of migrant workers have died as a result of the poor
              working conditions and exploitation. “Between 2010 and 2013, more
              than 1,200 labor migrants working in Qatar’s construction sector
              died, with another 4,000 deaths projected by the start of the
              event. Foreign workers are subject to conditions of forced labor,
              human trafficking, and indefinite detention. Advocacy groups cite
              deplorable living and working conditions, coupled with lax legal
              protections for workers, as the main culprits. Absent significant
              improvements in worker welfare, Qatar’s World Cup will be
              remembered as a human rights tragedy” (Ganji, n.d.)

            <p class="mb-5">
              Qatar is a developing country that wants to gain international
              standing. “Qatar is a wealthy country but it still is in the
              process of developing and the World Cup, like other mega sporting
              events, is used as a development tool” (Kavaler, 2020)
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Qatar’s social-political culture can historically be characterized
              by the exploitation of migrant workers, so this controversy isn’t
              an outlier for Qatar. “At the heart of the abuse faced by migrant
              workers is Qatar’s ‘Kafala’ system of sponsorship-based employment
              which legally binds foreign workers to their employers. Over the
              last decade, Amnesty International and others have shown how the
              system – which until recently prevented workers from changing jobs
              or even leaving the country without their employer’s permission –
              traps migrant workers in a cycle of abuse” (“Reality check:
              Migrant Workers' Rights with Two Years to the Qatar 2022 World
              Cup”, n.d.).

                Qatar desires to be recognized as a modern and prospering country regardless if it requires violating the human rights of migrants. 
“An investment in sports ... serves the purpose of putting the country on the map and gives them opportunities to build relations with many individuals and countries throughout the world. This is also part of Qatar’s branding efforts, along with migrant worker reforms, Reiche says, because it wants to be associated with the modern Arab state, like a Singapore of the Middle East” (Kavaler, 2020).

              <p class="mb-5">
                Qatar isn’t creating better working conditions because this controversy has made them see the error their ways, they are simply doing it to clean up their international image. 
                ““The World Cup is a driver for political change in Qatar because Qatar wants the recognition by the global community… It took some time for the Qatari elite to realize that they cannot achieve soft-power reputation gain when they don’t address the human rights issue. They are not changing the labor laws because the local population wants them to change, they are changing the labor laws because the western public has critically discussed over many years the treatment of the migrant workers” (Kavaler, 2020).
