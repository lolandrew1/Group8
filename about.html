              This page of the wiki should offer the initial brainstorm of the story that the VR experience is going to tell. This section will see a lot of revision over the course of the semester, hence the choice of initial brainstorm. This section should be drawing from week 3 and week 4 in our conversations about storytelling. 
<br><br>
              This page of the wiki should answer the following questions:
 <br><br>
Our story will detail the experience of the migrant workers who came to Qatar to construct the infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Starting from exploring what pushed so many people to leave their countries and work in terrible conditions for low pay in a foreign country to the workers viewing the products of their labor by the time the World Cup starts, we hope to give a comprehensive retelling of the stories of the workers. We will focus on the day-to-day lives of the workers, from showing their living conditions to viewing the type of work they did on a daily basis over the course of many years. The story of Qatar’s migrant workers is more nuanced than just some workers being treated poorly. Migrant workers in one of the world’s richest countries, which make up almost 90% of the country’s labor force, have been subjected to human rights violations that had generally been rid from society for decades if not centuries. In some cases workers were not allowed to quit the job or even leave the camp that they were staying at - meaning that the next edition of the world’s most-viewed tournament was built off the backs of forced laborers who - time-after-time - realized that they were being taken advantage even more and more.
In terms of coverage of the Qatar World Cup, the treatment of the migrant workers has been one of the main arguments amongst a plethora of complaints against a Qatari regime that has been accused of using the World Cup to ‘sportswash’. The general media coverage of Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup has been overwhelmingly negative, with there even being calls to strip Qatar of their hosting status. However, no significant action has been taken against the Qatari government or FIFA for allowing people to work in what could be considered subhuman conditions. Like many issues that captivate the attention of the world, attention gradually fades away as the media and the general public move on to another issue, leading to there being very little opposition to Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup today.
We hope that the VR experience will evoke strong feelings from the viewer about the plight of the migrant workers, and that it will hopefully make people think at least twice about the terrible things that happened in order to create this global sporting spectacle. And potentially, it could motivate the viewer to take some form of action in support of the workers or against Qatar/FIFA.
